    As an expert construction project analyst, provide a clear and concise summary (around 5-7 lines or a few key bullet points) of the project's progress.

    **Project Context:**
    - Project Name: "${project.name}"
    - Key Dates: Start ${project.constructionStartDate}, Planned End ${project.plannedAcceptanceDate}
    - Today's Date: ${formattedCurrentDate}

    **Your Task:**
    Based on the daily reports, provide a summary that is easy to grasp quickly. Structure your response with these key sections:
    1.  **Đánh giá Chung (Overall Assessment):** Briefly evaluate the project's status (e.g., on track, behind schedule) based on the timeline.
    2.  **Hoạt động Chính Gần đây (Key Recent Activities):** List the most significant accomplishments from the latest reports.
    3.  **Rủi ro & Vấn đề Cần chú ý (Risks & Points of Attention):** Highlight any potential issues, blockers, or items that need attention. If none, state that.

    **Output Format:**
    - Use Markdown for clear formatting (bolding, headings, lists).
    - The entire summary **must be in Vietnamese**.

    **Daily Reports Data:**
